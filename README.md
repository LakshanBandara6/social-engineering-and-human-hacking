## Abstract
Social engineering is a form of cyber-attack that goes beyond traditional hacking methods by exploiting **human psychology** to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.  
These attacks are increasingly widespread and sophisticated, evolving from simple email scams to AI-powered and deepfake-based deception.

This paper investigates:
- The **evolution** of social engineering techniques  
- The **modern implications** of targeted and AI-driven attacks  
- The **future developments** in the field, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI), deepfakes, and IoT  
- **Preventive measures** and awareness strategies to reduce vulnerability and strengthen human defenses  

## Structure of the Paper
1. **Introduction** – Background and significance of social engineering  
2. **Evolution** – Early phishing, vishing, pretexting, baiting, and targeted attacks  
3. **Future Developments** – AI, deepfake, and IoT-based attacks  
4. **Conclusion** – Insights into human vulnerabilities in cybersecurity  
5. **Recommendations** – Preventive strategies for individuals and organizations  
6. **References** – IEEE-formatted citations from verified cybersecurity sources
